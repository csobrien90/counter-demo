# Counter Demo

*A demo project for the Code Louisville Web Development pathway*

This project is a series of three simple counters using three different implementations: functional, OOP, and minimalist (still functional). Each allows you to increment and decrement a number. 

## Questions

### Functional

1. Does it work?
2. Is it accessible?
3. Is it safe? (secure and no undefined behavior)
4. How can we make this shorter?

### Object-Oriented

1. Is it legible?
2. Is it maintainable?
3. Is it reusable and extensible?
4. Is it testable?

### Minimalist

1. Explain this implementation in plain English.
2. What are the pros and cons of this implementation?
3. How short is too short?
4. Is it possible to make this even shorter?
